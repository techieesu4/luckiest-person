                              <p>You may seen my last few writings, heartly thankyou for all to be on my side. Now this to share my unlucky life with you and some of my luckiest persons in my life.</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>Like others my childhood was some what good.By without knowing the meaning of the word problems ,I have enjoyed my life as I liked …Ages gone ,I have understand the meaning of those words and survive with those things in day to day life.</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>I am not a student who scores good marks at first…To be frank till completing my primary schooling I am the one of the worst students among my batchmates….</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>At a stage somebody of them really thought the real meaning of the studies by their actions which dishonored me.Later I have spent some of my time even in my studies by which I found some good and trustworthy friends  with whom my relationship long-lasting till now. I am really thankful for those people who dishonored me!</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>You may think that my life was going perfectly and with peace.  Ofcourse till this my life was gone peacefully. But by now the word unlucky hits me badly.</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>During my secondary schooling I have decent knowledge about my subjects and enjoyed alot and with my three buddies and with some others too.These are the golden periods of my life. Later  I had move away from the school  to follow my career to a new atmosphere. Even At there, the persons who I have previously met are along with me but not like former. For every one it was the time where they have enjoy lot and had my unknown faces to close friends ,But for me there is nothing to say…On other hand I can’t able focus on my career and I have lost it at the very first step.</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>Later I have  joined   a college which may seems to look good,but I can’t adopt to this after completion of of 16 months. Days has gone. Everything changes but not my life…. I have facing failure in each and every thing I took part. My friends circle has completely  shrinking from utmost to even in single digits.I am continuing my college days just only simile on my face.</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>I haven’t found a  persons  who can sink with me in these last four past. Even  I have changed a lot from a person who Is familiar among bunch of good souls to a person familiar only among problems and failures!! From  beeing a person who have a good respect from others to a person with bad patches!! From the person who can socialize with everybody to person with nobody to  socialize!! Some of them who are around me are not even  know my name and my character. I like to increase my friend circle but I can’t do this really. Once  I bored of having to much of person with me,but I bored of being alone.I am the deservable  unlucky person to deserve these things..</p>
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <p> Besides , my unlucky life, I had the chance to met some of my luckiest persons . I  not  know  even those people are going to read this or not,But I really thankful to them</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>I have the best parents those who scarified everything for me .Without them I am not here now. They have encourage me in each and every situation in my failures.I have a lovable sister who is everything for me even I have some crazy fights with her.Thank you for them.</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>Then my friends especially my three buddies with who I have shared everything and we have good  memories too. I can’t get that again in my life.
